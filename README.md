## Upgrade Notice ##

### 3.0.0 ###
This release features several security fixes and enhancements.
It is highly recommended that all users upgrade immediately.


## Known Issues ##

### Storage Account Versions ###
Storage accounts can be created via CLI, classic Azure portal, or the new Azure portal,
with varying results.

If a Storage account is created with the new Azure portal, authentication will fail,
resulting in the inability to view/add containers or files. Creating a Storage account
with the Azure CLI should allow the plugin to work with new Storage accounts.

### Responsive Images in WordPress 4.4 ###
Images uploaded to the Azure Storage service will not automatically receive responsive versions.
Images added through the WordPress Media Loader *should* get automatically converted to responsive
images when inserted into a post or page.
We are investigating options for full support of responsive images in the plugin.
